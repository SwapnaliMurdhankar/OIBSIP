            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p>Virat Kohli (born November 5, 1988, Delhi, India) is an Indian international cricketer considered by many as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of the game. Kohli plays for (previously captained) the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He is also a former captain of the Indian cricket team in all three international formats—Test cricket, one-day internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 internationals (T20I)—making him one of India's most successful captains.
              
            Kohli holds several cricket records, including the most individual hundreds in ODI matches and the most runs scored in a single edition of an ODI World Cup.
            Kohli received the Arjuna Award, India's second highest sporting honor, from the government of India in 2013. In 2017 Kohli garnered the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian award. A stand at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi was renamed after Kohli in 2019.
